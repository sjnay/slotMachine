## Game Description

This slot machine is a little bit different than normal. There is no betting, but it is still completly based on luck.
Overview: A user will spin the machine in an attempt to "grow" crops for a garden.
There are 12 items all with different point values: 9 items that are positive points, 3 items are negative points.
There is one specific item combination that destroys the garden and starts the game over. It takes 50 points to grow one crop and you win by growing four crops.
User will see an overview of the game towards the top of the screen. As they grow their garden they will be able to watch the crops accumulate.
