# slotMachine
Project 1


This slot machine is a little bit different than normal. 
Overview: A user will spin the machine in an attempt to "grow" crops for their garden.
There are 10 items all with different point values: 8 items that are positive points, 2 items are negative points.
There is one specific item combination that destroys 
your garden and starts the game over. It takes 10 points to grow one crop and you win by growing three crops.

User will see an overview of the game towards the top of the screen. As they grow their garden they will be able to watch their points accumulate. 
Certain items, item combinations, and total point values will be accompanied with motivational messages and animations.
